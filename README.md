🎙️ Speaker Diarization using Fine-Tuned PyAnnote Segmentation
📌 Project Overview

This project implements speaker diarization — answering the question:

“Who spoke when?”

The system is built using PyAnnote Audio, where a speaker segmentation model is fine-tuned on custom audio data, followed by speaker embedding extraction and clustering to identify different speakers in an audio file.

This project is suitable for:

1. Call analysis
2. Meeting transcription
3. Surveillance / forensics
4. Conversational AI pipelines
5. Academic research & viva evaluation

🧠 What is Speaker Diarization?

Speaker diarization breaks an audio file into:
Speech vs non-speech
Speaker segments
Speaker labels (Speaker 1, Speaker 2, …)

Example output:
00:00–00:12  → Speaker 1
00:12–00:20  → Speaker 2
00:20–00:35  → Speaker 1

🎯 Key Features

✅ Fine-tuned speaker segmentation model
✅ Works on real-world conversational audio
✅ Supports variable number of speakers
✅ Uses Agglomerative Clustering
✅ Produces RTTM diarization output
✅ Visualization of speaker segments

🔊 Audio Requirements (Important)
All audio must be:
Mono (1 channel)
16 kHz sampling rate
WAV format

📌 Why?
PyAnnote models are trained on mono 16kHz
Stereo or different sampling rates reduce accuracy

🚀 How to Run the Project

1️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Prepare Dataset
Place audio files in dataset/audio/
Place RTTM files in dataset/rttm/
Configure paths in dataset/database.yml

4️⃣ Fine-Tune Segmentation Model
python scripts/train_segmentation.py

5️⃣ Run Speaker Diarization
python scripts/diarization.py --audio sample.wav

6️⃣ Visualize Output
python scripts/visualize.py

📊 Output Formats
RTTM file for evaluation
Speaker timeline plots
Segment-level speaker annotations

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Diarization Error Rate (DER)
False Alarm
Missed Speech
Speaker Confusion

🧪 Model Details
Base Model: PyAnnote Speaker Segmentation
Training: Supervised fine-tuning
Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy (segmentation)
Clustering: Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
Embeddings: Speaker embeddings from PyAnnote pipeline

⚠️ Limitations
Overlapping speech is challenging
Performance depends on audio quality
Needs sufficient labeled RTTM data

🌱 Future Improvements
🔹 Overlap-aware diarization
🔹 Domain-specific embedding fine-tuning
🔹 Real-time diarization
🔹 Integration with ASR (speech-to-text)
